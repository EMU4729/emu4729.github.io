			<h2>Skill areas</h2>
			Building a robot requires a wide range of skill areas, all of which you'll have a chance to participate in. You don't need any exprience; our mentors are here to develop your skills.

				<h3>Mechanical</h3>
				To construct the robots we use tools such as 3D printers and laser cutters. Don't forget the
				hand tools such as a hack saw or a sand mill.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="skill skill-right">
			<div>
				<h3>Computer-aided design</h3>
				We use a CAD software called Inventor which is used to create the models for the robots. We do this as we need
				to have a rough idea of what we are building as we only have limited materials.

			<div>
				<h3>Electrical</h3>
				Obviously we need electrical components on the robot so it can actually move. We use things such as the RoboRIO
				and other electrical components to build the robot.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="skill skill-right">
			<div>
				<h3>Software</h3>
				We have a software team which is dedicated to proggraming the robot. We used to proggram with java but are moving
				to c++ as, well java is java.
