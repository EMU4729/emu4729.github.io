			<h2>Skill areas</h2>
			Building a robot requires a wide range of skill areas, all of which you'll have a chance to participate in. You
			don't need any exprience; our mentors are here to develop your skills.

			<div>
				<h3>Computer-Aided Design (CAD)</h3>
				The goal of the CAD sub-team is to create digital models of our robots using Autodesk Inventor software. We use
				these designs to create prototypes of our ideas and finally use them to manufacture parts for our robot
				through machines such as 3D Printers, laser cutters and CNC Mills.

				<h3>Mechanical</h3>
				The mechanical team focuses on building the robot and following the CAD that
				the cad team made. Due to the small nature of our team, there is a large
				overlap between the mechanical and cad teams. They use tools like a laser
				printer, 3d printer and some hand tools to create the robot.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="skill skill-right">
			<div>
				<h3>Software</h3>
				The software team focuses on developing the code for making
				the robot actually move the robot. It is often the smallest
				group as there is a limited number of computers and a limited
				number of people who can code well and also their are less
				people who are interested in coding.

				<h3>Electrical</h3>
				The electrical team focuses on the electrical components
				and wiring of the robot where you will learn soldering and
				wiring skills. This is what connects the code to the
				mechanical parts of the robot.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="skill skill-right">
			<div>
				<h3>Media</h3>
				The media team is focused on the promotion and outreach. They
				take photos at other competitions and build/update the website.
