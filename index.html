	                <h2>Skill areas</h2>
	                Building a robot requires a wide range of skill areas, all of which you'll have a chance to participate in. You don't need any exprience; our mentors are here to develop your skills.

                        <h3>Mechanical</h3>
                        To construct the robots we use tools such as 3D printers and laser cutters. Don't forget the
			hand tools such as a hack saw or a sand mill.

                        We use a CAD software called ________ which is used to create the models for the robots. We do this as we need
			to have a rough idea of what we are building as we only have limited materials.

                        Obviously we need electrical components on the robot so it can actually move. We use things such as the RoboRIO
			and other electrical components to build the robot.

                        We have a software team which is dedicated to proggraming the robot. We used to proggram with java but are moving
			to c++ as, well java is java.
