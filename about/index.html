                    We are a team of appoximately 20 students who compete in FIRST robotic
                    competitions. We have a group of mentors who help us along the way with
                    building robots.

                        <h3>History of EMU4729</h3>
                        We started in 2012 and at that time there where only 4 mentors and 8 students. Our Robot 
                        that year (according to old members) the robot was made out of completely MDF. This year 
                        was completely for training and we didn't compete.

                        In 2013, though it wasn't our best year, it was our first major comp year 
                        where we made a 'carboard robot'.
                        <br><i class="fas fa-arrow-down"></i><br>
                        2014 our robot was actually made out of metal.

                        July 2016, <b>we started hosting GERRIC courses</b>. Where we teach younger kids
                        about robotics (CAD, elec, mechanical and coding). That year we also hosted a  
                        libary course for early-highschool students interested in Robotics.

                        2016, was our first big year as we won The Judges Award in FRC. As in FRC we <b>won our first
