                    We are a team of appoximately 30+ students who compete in FIRST robotic
                    competitions. We have a group of mentors who help us along the way with
                    building robots.

                    <h3>History of EMU4729</h3>
                    
                    In January 2020, we held robotics workshop for high school students. <br><i class="fas fa-arrow-down"></i><br> 
                    During 2020, the team had grown to over 30 students in the FRC team alone. <br><i class="fas fa-arrow-down"></i><br> 
                    In November 2019, our two FLL teams came 2nd and 4th in the first regional competition. <br><i class="fas fa-arrow-down"></i><br> 
                    In July 2019, the FLL Junior team participated in a demonstration, receiving a Synergy award. <br><i class="fas fa-arrow-down"></i><br> 
                    In April 2019, we started an FLL and an FLL Junior team, with 20 students joining in the first meeting. <br><i class="fas fa-arrow-down"></i><br> 
                    In 2018 we <b>won the Gracious Professionalism Award</b> at DDU2018, as we helped other teams. <br><i class="fas fa-arrow-down"></i><br> 
                    In 2017 we grew from 6 students in 2012 to over 20 students. <br><i class="fas fa-arrow-down"></i><br> 
                    2016, was our first big year as we won The Judges Award in FRC. As in FRC we <b>won our first award</b> for our grappling hook. We also won the Motivate Award in 2016. <br><i class="fas fa-arrow-down"></i><br> 
                    July 2016, <b>we started hosting GERRIC courses</b>. Where we teach younger kids about robotics (CAD, elec, mechanical and coding). That year we also hosted a libary course for early-highschool students interested in Robotics. <br><i class="fas fa-arrow-down"></i><br> 
                    In 2013, though it wasn't our best year, it was our first major comp year where we made a 'cardboard robot'. <br><i class="fas fa-arrow-down"></i><br> 
                    In January 2020, we held robotics workshop for high school students.We <b>started in 2012</b> and at that time there where only 4 mentors and 8 students. Our Robot that year was made out of completely MDF. This year was completely for training and we didn't complete. <br><i class="fas fa-arrow-down"></i><br>
