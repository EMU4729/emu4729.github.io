                    We are a team of appoximately 20 students who compete in FIRST robotic
                    competitions. We have a group of mentors who help us along the way with
                    building robots.

                        <h3>History of EMU4729</h3>
                        We <b>started in 2012</b> and at that time there where only 4 mentors and 8 students. Our Robot
                        that year was made out of completely MDF. This year was completely for training and we didn't complete.
                        <br><i class="fas fa-arrow-down"></i><br>
                        In 2013, though it wasn't our best year, it was our first major comp year
                        where we made a 'cardboard robot'.
                        <br><i class="fas fa-arrow-down"></i><br>
                        July 2016, <b>we started hosting GERRIC courses</b>. Where we teach younger kids
                        about robotics (CAD, elec, mechanical and coding). That year we also hosted a
                        libary course for early-highschool students interested in Robotics.

                        2016, was our first big year as we won The Judges Award in FRC. As in FRC we <b>won our first
                        award</b> for our grappling hook. We also won the Motivate Award in 2016.
                        <br><i class="fas fa-arrow-down"></i><br>
                        In 2017 we grew from 6 students in 2012 to over 20 students.
                        <br><i class="fas fa-arrow-down"></i><br>
                        In 2018 we <b>won the Gracious Professionalism Award</b> at DDU2018, as we helped other teams.
